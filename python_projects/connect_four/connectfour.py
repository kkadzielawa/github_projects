        This function first checks which player occupies (row,column).  If no
        player occupies this position, 0 is returned.  Otherwise, the function

        occupied by an opposing player.  The function then returns how many
        chips (including the first chip at (row, column), match.  Note if the
        function returns 4 or more, this is a winning position.
